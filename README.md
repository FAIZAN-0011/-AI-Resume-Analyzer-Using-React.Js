# -AI-Resume-Analyzer-Using-React.Js
I built an AI Resume Analyzer in React. It lets users upload a resume, sends it to an AI/mocked API, and shows ATS score, strengths, and weaknesses. I used React hooks, state management, components, and API integration. This project helped me learn real-world React application structure.


A simple React web application that analyzes a resume and gives:

- ATS Score  
- Strengths  
- Weaknesses  
- Improvement suggestions  

This is a clean beginner-friendly project built using React.js and JavaScript.
